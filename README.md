###### The model.ipyn includes all the model we build to predict whether the contaminant is above or below the minimum reporting level. It also includes the scatterplots of all the quantitative variables vs above MRL values to see if there is a relatively obvious pattern.
###### Uncomment any section of the models to run and see the train and test scores.
